# Posture Correction App for Mac
 This application is designed to help users improve their posture by detecting common posture issues such as forward head posture (“turtle neck”), drowsiness, and shoulder imbalance. Using real-time analysis, our app resolves these posture problems by issuing alerts on the user’s laptop whenever poor posture is detected. This method promotes better health and ergonomic improvements.
   
## Development Environments
- Python 3.10.10

## Features
- Turtle Neck Detection: Detects and alerts when a forward head posture is maintained for an extended period.
- Drowsiness Detection: Monitors signs of drowsiness based on size of eyes, sending alerts to encourage timely breaks.
- Shoulder Imbalance Detection: Analyzes gradient of shoulder and provides corrective feedback when an imbalance is detected.
